// Functions for creating and manipulating images that represent views of a night sky.

/** Given an image of the sky and a star, returns a version of the original image with
  * an image of the star placed on top. That is, forms an image of the star and places
  * it against the given (larger) image in a `Pos` that corresponds to the star’s
  * `StarCoords`.
  *
  * The star is depicted as a `White` circle whose diameter is `12.0 / (M + 2)`,
  * where `M` is the star’s magnitude. Its position within the resulting image is
  * determined by the star’s `posIn` method. The given star must have a magnitude
  * greater than -2.
  *
  * For example, say the background image is 400 by 400 pixels, and the given star has
  * the coords (0.5,0.0) and a magnitude of -0.5. The returned image will then consist of
  * the given background image with white circle of radius 4 placed upon it at (300,200).
  *
  * @param skyPic  an image to place the star upon
  * @param star    a star (of magnitude > -2) that should be depicted against the given image */

/** Given a `StarMap` that details what is visible in the sky, produces a `Pic`
  * that represents that information as an image. The background of the image is a
  * `Black` square of the given size. Each star and constellation in the sky appear
  * against that background.
