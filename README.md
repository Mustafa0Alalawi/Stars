# Stars

A simple Scala program that displays **star maps**â€”visual representations of the night sky with plotted stars and optional constellations. Each star is defined by its **coordinates**, and may be interactively viewed through a graphical window.

## Introduction

This project visualizes stars using their spatial coordinates on a 2D grid. It's designed to help represent:

- Individual stars with (x, y) coordinates
- Star maps of the night sky
- Groupings of stars to form **constellations**

The app provides an interactive way to explore stellar positions and could be extended for educational, simulation, or aesthetic purposes.



## Features

- Interactive GUI with plotted star points
- Mouseover tooltips showing exact star coordinates
- Basic constellation plotting support (future-ready)
- Simple and extensible structure in Scala

## Installation

Make sure you have [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) installed.

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mustafa0Alalawi/Stars.git
